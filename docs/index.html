        <h1 style="text-align:center"> I am Alexander Andrade</h1>
        <p>A problem solver who is passionate about tabletops. I'm currently writing my own tabletop, "Bloodsoaked Boots". A weird western tabletop set in an alternate early 1900s world not unlike our own.<br>
        I'm also working on the website you're looking at right now.</p>

            <h2>My Projects</h2>
            <h4>Bloodsoaked Boots</h4>
            <p>My main project that is a WIP. It is a weird western ttrpg (tabletop role-playing game) set in an alternate early 1900s North, Central and South America.<br>
                Set on the planet Caracol, players don different archtypes of humans as they attempt to live their lives in a harsh and steadily evolving world.<br>
                The newly formed 'Federal Government' tightens their iron grip over the people of the country.<br>
                Gangs press back using occult means that they steal from ancient orders,worshippers of the devil, and cults that worship the very emnations of god itself.<br>
                I plan to eventually host the pdf of my rpg once it's in a more presentable state. Email me if you'd like a copy of the alpha release!
            </p>
            <h4>My website</h4>
            <p>
                My porfolio of everything I'm working on and what I've worked on. I plan to eventually turn this site into a digital garden.<br>
                For now this iteration is mainly to talk about my projects and show off my coding projects.<br>
